# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## My Portfolio

A portfolio of my work that showcases my skills and talents to future employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. I have my first full stack project on a Covid Travel infomormation seacrh and 2 previous homework assignments such as the coding quiz and the weather dashboard. The other two are place holders for now.
